# PCA on African Economic Outlook Data

This project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch on African economic indicators to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance. The dataset contains missing values and non-numeric features, which were properly processed before applying PCA.

The repository includes a completed notebook and a simple Python PCA implementation.

Instructions to install and use the Python library are provided below.
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter and run all cells to reproduce the results.
